WhoWroteItLoader Sample App (Solution Code)
===========================================

The WhoWroteItLoader app extends the WhoWroteIt app to use an AsyncTaskLoader 
instead of an AsyncTask.  It accomplishes the same query to the Google Books API
as the original WhoWroteIt app, and handles configuration changes.  

Pre-requisites
--------------

For this app you should be familiar with:

* Creating and running apps in Android Studio.
* The Internet permission.
* Connecting to the Internet.
* Using an AsyncTaskLoader that preserves data across configuration changes.
* Updating the UI using loader callbacks.

Getting Started
---------------

1. Download and open the app in Android Studio.
